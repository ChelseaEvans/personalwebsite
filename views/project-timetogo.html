                        <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
                        <p>Interview another class member, identify a problem particular to them and solve it via an application.</p>
                        <p>Hitomi wants to remove the stress and time of mapping and calculating routes in order to be on time to places. She spent the last 2 years living in Tokyo, Japan and had recently moved back to Boston. In Tokyo, there are excellent mobile applications that provide information about bus and train times and everything arrives within seconds that they say they will. The Boston MBTA system provides inaccurate and inadequate information about train and bus times and requires significant overhead on her part in order to obtain correct information.</p>

                        <h3>TIME FRAME</h3>
                        <p>1 week, individual project.</p>

                        <h3>SKILLS</h3>
                        <p>User experience, user interface, competitor analysis, user interviews, user flow, testing, iteration.</p>

                        <h3>THE SOLUTION</h3>
                        <p>A mobile application that tells the user when to leave their current location in order to make it to their destination on time. The main intent is to reduce the overhead time of other mapping applications and provide optionally-repeating routes that minimal input by the user. "Go times" may change daily based on traffic conditions and public transportation schedules/times.</p>

                        <h3>RESEARCH &amp; ANALYSIS</h3>
                        <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
                        <p>The first application I researched was the current MBTA app. Hitomi mentioned that she had it, but doesn't use it due to lack of real-time and accurate data.
                        <p>When Hitomi explained to me her issue, I immediately thought of Google Maps. I've used it on different devices and found it to be very accurate for trip times and traffic. Hitomi explained that her issue with using Google Maps is that she is still doing a lot of manual work every single day, so I wanted to find a way to remove this overhead.
                        <p>Lastly, I took a quick look at Citymapper, an app that I had no previous knowledge of. I found it to have some similiar goals as the application that I was developing, but the added functionality was causing too much overhead for my target user and lacked the streamlined flow.

                        <h3>USER FLOW</h3>
                        <p>Initially, I found myself getting stuck on details too early, losing site of the real use of the application. I was fixed on times such as what time she wakes up, how long does it take for her to get ready, etc. I was also stuck on how she moved about the different locations from start to finish of her trip. Taking a step back, I developed the user flow and how she would move through the application. This provided perspective and allowed me to focus my thinking.</p>
                        <p>Iteration 1 contained many steps and considerations for the user. The final iteration was more simplified for the user, auto-saving routes and asking for all necessary information upfront.</p>

                        <p>Following multiple rounds of testing, I received the following feedback from the user: She doesn’t want to have to name the routes herself (they should auto name), wants to be able to save routes, wants to be able to reuse routes, some of the labels are vague and/or confusing, she wants to be able to access information about a route that she has used (i.e. average travel time, be able to see the map, etc.), wants the ability to ‘navigate’ if it’s a route she doesn’t know as well.</p>

                        <p>Based on user feedback I reiterated several times. This is where I really fleshed out the functionality and details:</p>

                            <li>Route is auto-saved once inputs have been entered</li>
                            <li>A user can reuse a route and is brought back to the edit screen in case they want to modify something about the route.</li>
                            <li>The alert notification is defaulted to 5 minutes; what does this look like?</li>
                            <li>The REPEAT and USED ROUTES screens will display certain information relevant to the user.</li>
                            <li>Careful consideration of word use, placement of items, buttons, etc.</li>
                            <li>What’s clickable? How do I let the user know?</li>
                            <li>Final check: Am I meeting all of the user’s requirements?</li>
